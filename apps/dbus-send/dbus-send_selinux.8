.SH "NAME"
dbus-send_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the dbus-send processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the dbus-send processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The dbus-send processes execute with the dbus-send_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep dbus-send_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The dbus-send_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBdbus-send_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the dbus-send_t domain are the following:

/usr/bin/dbus-send
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux dbus-send policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dbus-send processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for dbus-send:

.EX
.B dbus-send_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a dbus-send_t
can be used to make the process type dbus-send_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  dbus-send policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run dbus-send with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow all domains to execute in fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P fips_mode 1

.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux dbus-send policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dbus-send processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.I The following file types are defined for dbus-send:


.EX
.PP
.B dbus-send_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the dbus-send_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dbus-send_t domain.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
